# Arcade Hall Management System

A Python CLI application for managing an Arcade Hall where players can register, play games, and track high scores. This system provides a complete solution for arcade operators to manage player registrations, record game scores, and display leaderboards.

## 🎮 Features

- **Player Registration**: Register new players with unique usernames
- **Score Recording**: Record scores for different arcade games
- **Leaderboard System**: View top 10 high scores for each game
- **Database Persistence**: SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite database
- **Sample Data Seeding**: Populate database with test data using Faker
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete for all entities
- **Database Migrations**: Alembic for schema management

# Alembic configuration

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pipenv for dependency management

### Setup

1. Clone or download the project
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install dependencies: `pipenv install`

# Starting the Application

**Method 1: Activate virtual environment first (Recommended)**

```bash
pipenv shell
python cli.py
```

**Method 2: Run directly with pipenv**

```bash
pipenv run python cli.py
```

**Method 3: If dependencies installed globally**

```bash

## 🗄️ Database Schema

The application uses SQLite with the following schema:

### Players Table

| Column   | Type    | Description        |
| -------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| id       | INTEGER | Primary key        |
| username | TEXT    | Unique player name |

### Scores Table

| Column    | Type    | Description            |
| --------- | ------- | ---------------------- |
| id        | INTEGER | Primary key            |
| player_id | INTEGER | Foreign key to players |
| game_name | TEXT    | Name of the game       |
| score     | INTEGER | Score achieved         |

## 🎯 Key Features Explained

## 🛠️ Development

### Code Organization

- **Interactive CLI**: Menu-driven interface that keeps users engaged
- **Input Validation**: Validates all user inputs with helpful error messages
- **Modular Design**: Separated concerns with clear module boundaries
- **Database Layer**: Isolated database operations in `lib/db/`
- **CLI Layer**: Interactive interface logic in `lib/cli.py`
- **Data Models**: Type-safe data structures in `models.py`

### Testing with Sample Data

Use menu option 4 to quickly populate the database with sample data.

This creates:

- 5 sample players (alice, bob, charlie, diana, eve)
- 10 sample scores across 4 different games (Pac-Man, Street Fighter, Galaga, Donkey Kong)
- Realistic test data for development and demonstration

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Dependencies
